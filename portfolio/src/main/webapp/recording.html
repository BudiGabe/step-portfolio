      <p> One of my dreams is to learn to play as many instruments as possible,
          and become an awesome one man band.
          For now, I can play:
      <button onclick="toggleKaval">Kaval with Guitar</button>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/kaval.jpg" width="316" height="460">
        <audio controls>
          <source src="audio/kaval.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
      </div>
    </div>
