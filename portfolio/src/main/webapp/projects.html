      <h2><a href="https://github.com/Razoku/Dungeon-Clicker">Dungeon Clicker</a></h2>
      <p>Developed when clicker games were gaining a lot of traction, in this game you
         are a hero who must go through multiple levels in a dungeon where monsters get 
         tougher and tougher. Slay enemies, level up, upgrade abilities and see how far
         you can go.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/Razoku/Workout-Planner">Workout Planner</a></h2>
      <p>When you're working out, calculating the weight of your next set is tedious.
         With this app, just insert the percentage you want to work with and let it
         do the work for you. Moreover, you can use the in-built templates for the 5/3/1
         workout and it's brother, BBB.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/Razoku/Kitesurfing-App">Kitesurfing App</a></h2>
      <p>I didn't even know that kitesurfing is a thing before making this app. One of
         the more refined apps from this list, you can find kitesurfing spots all around
         the world, along with useful information such as wind speed. And you can favorite
         spots so you never miss them.</p>

         overlord and defend your base from the goody two-shoes heroes.</p>
